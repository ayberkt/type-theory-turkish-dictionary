# type-theory-turkish-dictionary

This project aims to be analogue of `@anjapetkovic`'s
[`type-theory-slovene-dictionary`][0] for the Turkish language.

This is supposed to be a reflection of what the community thinks should be
standard rather than my personal preferences. However, to get this started, I am
filling the dictionary with what *I* feel are good translations as preliminary
approximations. Therefore, I encourage *anyone* interested to make a pull
request in case they have any comments, complaints, or suggestions.
